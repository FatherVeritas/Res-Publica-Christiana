      <h2>The World Is Breaking — And Everyone Knows It</h2>
      <p>
Something is deeply wrong. The modern order is collapsing before our eyes. Western Civilization is on the edge of dissolution, economies are manipulated by unseen hands, Governments are ruled by children. The One, True Church, is ashamed of her identity, and She who ought to be the moral conscience of nations, now apologizes for her very eixstence. And while the world flails in confusion, a technocratic elite openly admits they seek to enthrone Artificial Intelligence as the new god of mankind. 
</p>

<p>
And yet—beneath the surface, there is a yearning, a hunger across nations. Mankind is grown sick of a diet of lies, and yearns for Truth, for order, for meaning and purpose - but none is offered. We live under the fading enchantment of a dying age, the dying embers of a spell cast by nihilistic materialism.
</p>

<p>
But what if the answer is not new? What if the blueprint for a just society, ordered to the common good and capable of bringing peace and happiness to the world, has already been given? What if the future lies not in the next experiment, but in returning to the one civilization that ever truly united heaven and earth?
</p>

<p>
That civilization was Christendom—the product not of theories, but of saints, kings, monks and martyrs. It was forged in the chaos after the fall of Rome, when barbarism ruled and hope seemed lost. And yet from those ashes, Christendom rose: not only surviving, but taming the wild, building cathedrals, establishing law, uplifting the poor, and giving birth to the very idea of the West.
</p>

<p>
Christendom did not die, it was betrayed and overthrown—by revolutions, by heresy, by the worship of man in the place of God. But the old fire still burns beneath the rubble. The time has come to light it again.
</p>

<p>
Integralism is the path forward. Not a nostalgic dream, but a tested, time-hardened vision—a society ordered to the reign of Christ the King. The future belongs to those who dare to rebuild what was lost. This site exists to chart that future, to proclaim that Christendom must rise again—and to help bring it about, with all the glory, truth, and beauty that once made the world a place worth living.

      <h2>What Is Catholic Integralism?</h2>
      <p>
Catholic Integralism is the belief that the political and social order should be directed toward man’s final end: God. It refuses to accept the false division between Church and State that has dominated modern politics. Integralism holds that Christ is not only King of Heaven, but also King of Earth—and therefore, the laws of nations, the shape of society, and the souls of citizens must be ordered to His reign.
</p>

<p>
It is not a totalitarianism of man, but the rightful totality of truth. Integralism acknowledges that both Church and State have their roles—distinct, but not separate. The State governs the temporal order, protecting justice and peace. But when questions arise that touch on man's eternal end, the Church must guide. Just as the soul must rule the body, so too must the spiritual authority guide the temporal. This harmony of powers is not tyranny—it is the only possible foundation for lasting peace and moral order.
</p>

<p>
Every modern social alternative has failed. The Enlightenment, enthroned man, declared religion a private matter, and offered us the cold idol of secularism. The French Revolution promised liberty, equality, and fraternity - but gave us slavery to the passions, moral collapse, and spiritual death. Catholic Integralism sees this for what it is: the frenzied rebellion of the Devil  against the kingship of Christ. But the Devil will always lose. 
</p>

<p>
Catholic Integralism is not a longing for the past—it is a blueprint for the future. It draws from the deep wells of Catholic tradition, Thomistic philosophy, papal teaching, and the lived experience of Christian civilization. It is not afraid to speak of authority, hierarchy, virtue, or the common good. It calls for rulers who serve, families who pray, laws that uphold justice, and a culture that dares to name God as its King.
</p>

<p>
In a world collapsing under its own lies, Integralism is the antidote: a vision that restores harmony between heaven and earth, between Faith and reason, between the soul of man and the society he builds. It is Christendom reborn—not in fantasy, but in reality.

      <h2>Why Sara Rose Smith?</h2>
      <p>
  The question may be raised - is Sara Rose Smith integral to Integralism? The answer indeed, forsooth and verily, is yes! She is absolutely necessary, in all her magnificent, autistic, addle-brained genius. Who else, in truth, has the power to march straight up to the gates of hell, pound on the doors, demand to speak to the head demon in charge, punch him in the nose, and then say "My priest Fr. Nolan says you stink! He's not afraid of you! Now hmph! You just go ahead and try to make his life miserable, you'll see!" 
        </P
          <p>
    Who else indeed, would be so bold as to demand holy hours be prayed for her, at all hours of the night, and at the drop of a hat? Who else could pose such a spiritual challenge to direct her properly, so that even the most peaceful, and peace-loving of priests is forced to leave behind his life of comfort, and reach the heights of sanctity, just to be up to the task of directing one of God's most precious of catastrophes?  Oh yes my friends, Sara Rose Smith is most indeed integral to Integralism. And besides - who else has access to the secretive and powerful Church of JOSH?
